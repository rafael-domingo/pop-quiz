# pop-quiz
How well do you know your own music?

# Introduction
Quiz yourself on your own music library. See if you can tell who your top artist and track are and then take a listen to some samples and see if you can guess the track name. Then, using the Musix Match API, we'll test to see if you can guess which track a lyric belongs to. 

This requires a Spotify account to use since it utilizes Spotify metadata to create your personalized quiz.
